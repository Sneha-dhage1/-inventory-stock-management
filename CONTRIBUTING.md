# Branching Strategy

- **main**: Production-ready stable code.
- **dev**: Integration branch for development.
- **feature/***: Feature branches off `dev`.

## Workflow

1. Create feature branches off `dev`.
2. Submit pull requests to `dev`.
3. After review and testing, merge `dev` into `main` for release.
